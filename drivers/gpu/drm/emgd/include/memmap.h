 * Function: os_map_io_to_mem_cache
 *
 * Description:
 *  This function will reserve a range of virtual memory space of "size" and 
 *  map the that virtual address to the hardware "base_address" provided. This 
 *  function call will enable caching of read write transactions to the region.
 * Parameters:
 *              IN: base_address -> the base bus/hardware address that will be
 *                                  used as the target of the memory mapping.
 *              IN: size-> the size of the virtual memory range requested to
 *                         be mapped
 * Return Value:
 *              NULL for failure OR
 *              valid virtual address casted as a void *

 *
 * Description:
 *  This function will reserve a range of virtual memory space of "size" and 
 *  map the that virtual address to the hardware "base_address" provided. This 
 *  function call will NOT cache any read/write transactions to the region and 
 *  apply the access directly to the hardware bus address that is mapped.
 * Parameters:
 *              IN: base_address -> the base bus/hardware address that will be
 *                                  used as the target of the memory mapping.
